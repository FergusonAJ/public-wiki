## May 24 - The antiquity of RNA-based evolution - Alex

**Paper:** Joyce, G. F. (2002). [The antiquity of RNA-based evolution](https://www.nature.com/articles/418214a). Nature, 418(6894), 214–221. [https://doi.org/10.1038/418214a](https://doi.org/10.1038/418214a).

### RNA World Hypothesis

RNA World - a hypothesized era on Earth where genetic information resided in the sequence of RNA molecules and the phenotype derived from the catalytic properties of RNA.

(Joyce, 2002)'s RNA World Story

- Chemical building blocks for RNA-based life that _may_ have been available in the pre-biotic environment:
  - amino acids, hydroxy acids, sugars, purines, pyrimidines, fatty acids
  - These building blocks combined to form polymers (polymer = large molecule, composed of many repeated subunits)
- Some polymers may have had special properties: e.g., adherence to surfaces, resistance to degradation, tendency to form large aggregates
  - Eventually, though, _all_ of these types of polymers with special properties would have succumbed to degradation
- If polymers capable of giving rise to copies of themselves arise + the rate of self-replication > the rate of degradation of existing copies: that self-replicating type of polymer is able to persist in the environment
  - Polymer sequences that are better able to self-replicate will achieve higher concentrations than other self-replicating sequences
  - \+ imperfect replication => evolution by natural selection
- A changing environment would have selected for general purpose (more robust) replication machinery (e.g., RNA replication machinery)

Each of those bullets and the transitions from one to the next are wrought with open questions.

Some open questions (as of this paper)

- What are plausible mechanisms for the emergence of RNA from the 'prebiotic clutter'?
- Could the RNA world have been preceded by some other genetic system?
- RNA world to a DNA-protein world?


### Discussion questions

- Alternatives to the RNA world hypothesis?
- What is the role of digital systems in origins of life/RNA world research?
  - Simulated chemistry systems (e.g., modeling actual chemical reactions) <========> ALife artificial chemistry systems
